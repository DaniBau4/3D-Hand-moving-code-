This repo contains the construction of a robotic hand based on the open source model InMoov. The hand was built
using low-cost materials, making it an economical and viable solution for reproduction. 
To build the robotic hand, we reproduced the design of the
open source project InMoov, which offers a model for
the development of 3D printed robotics. The pieces were edited in the
Ultimaker Cura software to optimize their structure and prepare them for
printing. The printing was done using an Anycubic Kobra printer with 1.75 mm diameter PLA filament. The pieces are then glued together with two-component epoxy glue.
The hand movement system was implemented using six MG996R servo motors (five for each finger and one for the wrist), which
offer a torque of up to 11 kg/cm and a rotation of 180Â°. To control the tension, we used 0.4 mm gauge fishing line, combined
with a 60 Lb brake system, which ensures the necessary resistance to keep the structure in position after each movement. The motors
and the thread generate a pulley system, through which the fingers can
be closed or opened. In the case of the wrist, there is a servomotor placed
in this part, connected to a gear that causes the rotation.
