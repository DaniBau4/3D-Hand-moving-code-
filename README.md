This repo contains the construction of a robotic hand based on the open source model InMoov. The hand was built
using low-cost materials, making it an economical and viable solution for reproduction. The hand parts were edited
in Ultimaker Cura and manufactured on an Anycubic Kobra printer with PLA filament.
